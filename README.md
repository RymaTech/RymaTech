# Founders & Coders (Cohort 16)

[Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) programme offers 16-week full-stack JavaScript course for 16 students. It is peer-led and project-based working in 4 teams. To apply to the programme, I needed to complete [course prerequisites](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply) first. Afterwards, I invited to interview and offered a place. The course for cohort 16 started on 3 March 2019 and will end 5 July 2019.
