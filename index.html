        <div class="profile-item">
          <p class="p-item">On 31st July 2018 I made the decision to leave behind a career in law and take the plunge into my passion, software
          development. It was on the aforementioned date that I began completing the prerequisites to gain a place onto the highly
          competitive Founders & Coders programme.</p>
          
          <p class="p-item">Prior to joining Founders & Coders, I was becoming more and more aware of technology and its impact on our everyday
          lives. I began following technology news and attending the occasional tech meetup. I have always been entrepreneurial
          and once I discovered the capabilities of technology, I began coming up with solutions to everyday problems all of which
          had technology at their core. Naturally, I did not have the skills or finance to build these ideas. A desire to not only
          create these ideas but understand how they were built lead to discover Founders & Coders.</p>
          
          <p class="p-item">I am now looking for a JavaScript Developer position, preferably with a tech stack that includes Node.js and React.js,
          which will allow me to build upon my one-year of software development experience.</p>
